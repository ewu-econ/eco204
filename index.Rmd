Salam Everyone! This is course webpage of **ECO 204 (Section 7)**, current semester is **Summer 2025**.

This course is an introduction to **Statistical Inference**. Broadly the discipline of Statistics falls under two categories: **Descriptive Statistics** and **Inferential Statistics**. This will focus on the latter, which is the process of drawing conclusions about a population based on a sample.

The prerequisite for this course is ECO 104, which is an introduction to **Descriptive Statistics** and **Probability Theory**. It is assumed that you have already successfully completed the course, if not please drop this course and take it later. 

In this course, we will learn how to use statistical methods to make inferences about a population based on sample data. We will cover various topics including **estimation, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, time series analysis, analysis of variance techniques and some non-parametric testing**.
