Salam everyone! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the ECO 204 (Section 7) course page for **Summer 2025**. Weâ€™re thrilled to have you on board.

In this class you will do a somewhat deep dive into **Statistical Inference** â€” the part of statistics that lets us say smart things about a whole population **just by studying a sample**. Remember, there are two big branches of Statistics: **Descriptive Statistics** (summarizing what you see in a data) and **Inferential Statistics** (drawing broader conclusions from the data). Weâ€™re now in the second one. By now all of you should already have ECO 104 under your arsenal (whcih covers essentially Descriptive Stats + Probability). If you havenâ€™t taken 104 yet, please take it first and come back here later... sorry!

Over the next few weeks weâ€™ll explore **estimation, hypothesis testing, regression, time-series analysis, ANOVA, and some non-parametric tests**. It might sound like a lot, but once you get the ideas youâ€™ll see how powerfulâ€”and funâ€”these topics are.

A quick heads-up: **PLEASE, and PLEASE again ... show up to every class.** This summer term is short, and each session builds on the previous one, so **missing even a single class can make your life very difficult later**.

Weâ€™re **Tanvir Hossain** (your instructor) and **Habiba Afroz** (the TA for this course) from the [Economics Department at East West University](https://fbe.ewubd.edu/economics-department). Reach out anytime to us via Discord DM, Google Classroom, or office hoursâ€”if you need help or just want to talk about Statistics. Thanks again, letâ€™s have a great term together!

You will get the course outline in PDF soon.... please check the webpage frequently for updates.
