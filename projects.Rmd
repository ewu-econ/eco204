Choose one dataset from the list below. For the dataset you select, complete all tasks written in the [Project Details](project_work/Project_Details.pdf) document. You have following two options,

  - **Doing Work using MS Excel + MS Word:** In this case you perform the regression using MS Excel, write the report in MS Word, and submit the Excel file and a PDF (produced from the Word, I will not accept the MS Word file) file.
  - Or, 
  - **Doing the work using R and LaTeX:** In this case you perform the regression using R, write the report in R Markdown, and submit the knitted HTML file (or PDF file) and the R Markdown file.

If you submit both a fully reproducible R Markdown report and a LaTeX write-up, you will receive a +3 bonus points on the final exam.

Datasets are allocated on a **first-come, first-served** basis. To reserve a dataset, email STH or Habiba Afroz or Write in Discord with your group members' name and the chosen dataset â€” **once a dataset is reserved for a group it cannot be used by others**. Groups may have **at most two members**. So please send me an email or write in Discord with the following information as soon as you can.

- Group Members' Names
- Dataset Name (e.g., earns, approval, etc.)


If you have questions about a dataset or need an exception, contact the Me or Habiba Afroz via email or Discord.
